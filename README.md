Assignment Reminder Bot – No-Code Automation with Make.com
🔍 Overview
The Assignment Reminder Bot is a no-code automation workflow built using Make.com. It helps students stay on top of assignment deadlines by sending automated Telegram reminders and logging key details in Google Sheets.

This project demonstrates how to integrate multiple tools — Google Calendar, Telegram, and Google Sheets — to solve a real-world problem using a visual automation platform.

🎯 Problem Solved
Many students struggle to track upcoming deadlines, often missing assignments due to lack of timely reminders. This automation addresses that by:

Monitoring Google Calendar for upcoming assignment events

Sending reminder messages at key intervals (2 days before, 1 day before, and on the day)

Recording reminder activity in a Google Sheet for transparency and review

⚙️ How It Works
Google Calendar: Event labeled “Assignment” is created

Make.com Scenario:

Watches for new/updated calendar events

Calculates time remaining to the event

Filters trigger messages based on how close the due date is

Telegram Bot: Sends the reminder to the user via a custom bot

Google Sheets: Logs assignment name, date, reminder time, and status
